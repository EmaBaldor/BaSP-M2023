# **Mega Rocket GYM**

Mega Rocket is a practical web development project created with the purpose of learning to use web development tools and learning to work as a team.

The project is based on a gym website called **Mega Rocket GYM** that manages administrators, trainers, users, as well as classes and memberships.

Progress by weeks:

## *Week 01*
We layout the website in **Figma**. We work on styles, screens, functionalities and flows.

## *Week 02*
We build the landing page in **HTML** emphasizing the structure, syntax, basic tags, semantic elements. Then we upload it to a **Github** repository.

## *Week 03*
We recreate the landing page with **CSS** styles
without the sidebar and without using flexbox, grid, measures in percentages and absolute position.
